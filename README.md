# Spam Classifier 

A project for classifying whether the email/text received is <b>Spam</b> or <b>Ham</b>.
I have used here <b>Naive Bays classifier</b> for training the model and deployed using Flask. You can have a look of the working project from the link below.

## Published Site
 https://flask-email-classifier.herokuapp.com/
 
## Build With
- Python
- ML (used Naive Bays classifier)
- Flask
- HTML, CSS, JS

<br>
In this project I learnt and worked on important steps like:


<pre>
  🔸 𝑬𝑫𝑨 (𝑬𝒙𝒑𝒍𝒐𝒓𝒂𝒕𝒐𝒓𝒚 𝒅𝒂𝒕𝒂 𝒂𝒏𝒂𝒍𝒚𝒔𝒊𝒔)    
          
  🔸 𝑫𝒂𝒕𝒂 𝑷𝒓𝒆𝒑𝒓𝒐𝒄𝒆𝒔𝒔𝒊𝒏𝒈
          - Text Cleaning Procedures
              ⚬  converting all words in document to lower case
              ⚬  Tokenizing
              ⚬  Removing stop words
              ⚬  Word stemming
              ⚬  Word lemmatization
              ⚬  Removing punctuations
              ⚬  Stripping out HTML tags
          𝐍𝐋𝐓𝐊 library was there to think out of the box!
              
  🔸 𝑭𝒆𝒂𝒕𝒖𝒓𝒆 𝑬𝒙𝒕𝒓𝒂𝒄𝒕𝒊𝒐𝒏
          - CountVectorizer Method
          - Full Matrix Creation
          - Vocabulary Creation
          
  🔸 𝑨𝒍𝒈𝒐𝒓𝒊𝒕𝒉𝒎 𝑰𝒎𝒑𝒍𝒆𝒎𝒆𝒏𝒕𝒂𝒕𝒊𝒐𝒏
          - CountVectorizer + Naïve Bayes Algorithm
          
  🔸 𝑺𝒄𝒐𝒓𝒊𝒏𝒈 & 𝑴𝒆𝒕𝒓𝒊𝒄𝒔 :
          - Accuracy
          - Precision
          - Recall
